# Rahul's Personal Chatbot ðŸ¤–ðŸ“„

Rahul's AI Clone Chatbot â€“ A Streamlit-based chatbot that allows users to upload PDFs, process them using Llama 3 (Groq), and chat with Rahul's AI clone through the chatbox. The chatbot retrieves contextual information from ChromaDB for more accurate responses.

I have already uploaded a PDF of my bio and deployed my AI clone on Streamlit. You can check it out at the link below. (Note: I will hide the Groq API key after a few days of pushing the project.)
